## Steps to Contribute

### 1️⃣ Raise or Select an Issue
- Check the **Issues** tab to find something you'd like to work on.
- If you don’t see what you’re looking for, feel free to **open a new issue** describing the feature, bug, or improvement.

### 2️⃣ Wait for Assignment
- Once you’ve commented on or created an issue, **wait for a maintainer to assign it to you** before starting work.  
  This helps avoid duplicate efforts.

### 3️⃣ Code & Make a Pull Request
- Fork the repository and clone it locally.  
- Create a new branch for your changes.
- Make your edits, test them, and commit.
- Push your branch and open a **Pull Request (PR)** linking it to the relevant issue.
